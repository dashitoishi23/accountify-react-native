      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>Effective Date: 22nd October 2024</p>

      <p>
        Thank you for using Accountify. Your privacy is important to us, and we
        are committed to safeguarding your personal information. This Privacy
        Policy outlines the types of data the app collects and how it is used.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        This app operates entirely offline. All data, including your personal
        budget and expense information, is stored locally on your device. The
        app does not collect, transmit, or share any data to external servers,
        third parties, or cloud services.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Use of Data</h2>
      <p>
        The data you input into the app is only accessible to you. It is used
        solely for the purpose of managing your budget and tracking your
        expenses according to the app's functionality. Since the app works
        offline, no data is sent over the internet.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your data remains stored on your device. We recommend that you take
        necessary precautions to protect your device, such as using a passcode,
        fingerprint, or face authentication to prevent unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        All data is retained on your device for as long as you use the app. If
        you uninstall the app or delete its data manually, all stored
        information will be permanently erased.
      </p>

      <h2>5. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        As the app functions entirely offline, there is no interaction with
        third-party services or external platforms. Your data is never shared,
        sold, or transferred to any third party.
      </p>

      <h2>6. User Control</h2>
      <p>
        You have full control over the data stored in the app. You can modify or
        delete any information at any time within the app settings.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy. Any changes will be
        reflected within the app. Please check this section periodically for
        updates.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
